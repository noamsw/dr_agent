# Pharmacy Agent
In this project I have created a agent that acts as a pharmacist assistant. 
This agent can be used to query information about:
- Medication doses and uses.
- Prescription requierments for medication.
- Availability of the medication at the store.
- Reservation of medication, and cancellation of reservations.
- User prescriptions and reservations.
  
## The project includes the following files:
- main.py
- agent.py
- tools.py
- inventory.json
- medications.json
- users.json
